SIADS 696 Milestone II Project - This repository contains the code, data processing steps, and analysis related to UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6).

## Project Title: Machine Learning for SDG6: Forecasting Basic Water Access

This project aims to identify and predict regions at risk of water stress and poor sanitation using data-driven methods, helping uncover patterns and predictors of water-related inequality. The goal is to understand which factors contribute most to water insecurity, enabling targeted interventions.
